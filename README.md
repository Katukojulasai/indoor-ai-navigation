Indoor AI Navigation

Project Name: Indoor AI Navigation â€“ Smart Indoor Positioning System

Description:
Indoor AI Navigation is a system designed to guide users within indoor environments like malls, hospitals, airports, or large offices. The system uses AI, computer vision, and sensor-based localization (e.g., BLE, Wi-Fi, or LiDAR) to provide accurate indoor positioning and navigation. It helps users find locations efficiently and can also assist in emergency evacuation by providing optimal paths.

Your Role:

Designing navigation algorithms for indoor environments

Integrating sensors and AI for positioning accuracy

Building a pathfinding and guidance system

Creating user-friendly mobile or web interfaces

Algorithms Used:

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

Pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)

Sensor fusion algorithms for positioning (Kalman filter)

Computer vision for obstacle detection

Programming Languages and Technologies:

Python, OpenCV, ROS (Robot Operating System)

TensorFlow / Keras for AI

Arduino / Raspberry Pi for sensor integration

Mobile app development with React Native / Flutter

Techniques Used:

Sensor data preprocessing and fusion

Real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance

Indoor mapping and visualization

Integration with mobile apps for navigation display

Advantages:

Accurate indoor navigation without GPS

Enhances user experience in large facilities

Supports emergency route planning

Can integrate with IoT devices for automation

Disadvantages:

Requires installation of sensors and beacons

High setup cost for large environments

Accuracy can be affected by dynamic obstacles or interference

Impact:

Improves efficiency and user satisfaction in indoor spaces

Reduces human dependency for directions

Enhances safety with optimized evacuation paths
